# Stretched Cell Cycle

This a model of cell cycle. There is a single timer that determines whether the cell is in G1, S or G2/M. The model simulates the results of BrdU pulse staining and 7AAD point in time staining and writes Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) files. The output reproduces fig 4A of this paper: [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24733943/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24733943/).
